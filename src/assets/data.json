                 "description": "\"This is how we did it.\" --Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel<br /><br />It all started with a series of odd statistics. The leading challenger to Microsoft's stranglehold on the computer industry is an operating system called Linux, the product of thousands of volunteer programmers who collaborate over the Internet. The software behind a majority of all the world's web sites doesn't come from a big company either, but from a loosely coordinated group of volunteer programmers called the Apache Group. The Internet itself, and much of its core software, was developed through a process of networked collaboration.<br /><br />The key to these stunning successes is a movement that has come to be called open source, because it depends on the ability of programmers to freely share their program source code so that others can improve it. In 1997, Eric S. Raymond outlined the core principles of this movement in a manifesto called \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar,\" which was published and freely redistributed over the Internet.<br /><br />Mr. Raymond's thinking electrified the computer industry. He argues that the development of the Linux operating system by a loose confederation of thousands of programmers--without central project management or control--turns on its head everything we thought we knew about software project management. Internet-enabled collaboration and free information sharing, not monopolistic control, is the key to innovation and product quality.<br /><br />This idea was interesting to more than programmers and software project leaders. It suggested a whole new way of doing business, and the possibility of unprecedented shifts in the power structures of the computer industry.<br /><br />The rush to capitalize on the idea of open source started with Netscape's decision to release its flagship Netscape Navigator product under open source licensing terms in early 1998. Before long, Fortune 500 companies like Intel, IBM, and Oracle were joining the party. By August 1999, when the leading Linux distributor, Red Hat Software, made its hugely successful public stock offering, it had become clear that open source was \"the next big thing\" in the computer industry.<br /><br />This revolutionary book starts out with \"A Brief History of Hackerdom\"--the historical roots of the open-source movement--and details the events that led to the recognition of the power of open source. It contains the full text of \"The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar,\" updated and expanded for this book, plus Mr. Raymond's other key essays on the social and economic dynamics of open source software development.<br /><br />Open source is the competitive advantage in the Internet Age. <i>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</i> is a must for anyone who cares about the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come.",

                 "description": "WTF? can be an expression of amazement or an expression of dismay. In today’s economy, we have far too much dismay along with our amazement, and technology bears some of the blame. In this combination of memoir, business strategy guide, and call to action, Tim O'Reilly, Silicon Valley’s leading intellectual and the founder of O’Reilly Media, explores the upside and the potential downsides of today's WTF? technologies. <br /><br />What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or done only by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies—to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? How should companies organize themselves to take advantage of these new tools? What’s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? How can individuals continue to adapt and retrain? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them? <br /><br />O'Reilly is \"the man who can really can make a whole industry happen,\" according to Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google.) His genius over the past four decades has been to identify and to help shape our response to emerging technologies with world shaking potential—the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data, and now AI. O’Reilly shares the techniques he's used at O’Reilly Media  to make sense of and predict past innovation waves and applies those same techniques to provide a framework for thinking about how today’s world-spanning platforms and networks, on-demand services, and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of business, education, government, financial markets, and the economy as a whole. He provides tools for understanding how all the parts of modern digital businesses work together to create marketplace advantage and customer value, and why ultimately, they cannot succeed unless their ecosystem succeeds along with them.<br /><br />The core of the book's call to action is an exhortation to businesses to DO MORE with technology rather than just using it to cut costs and enrich their shareholders. Robots are going to take our jobs, they say. O'Reilly replies, “Only if that’s what we ask them to do! Technology is the solution to human problems, and we won’t run out of work till we run out of problems.\" Entrepreneurs need to set their sights on how they can use big data, sensors, and AI to create amazing human experiences and the economy of the future, making us all richer in the same way the tools of the first industrial revolution did. Yes, technology can eliminate labor and make things cheaper, but at its best, we use it to do things that were previously unimaginable! What is our poverty of imagination? What are the entrepreneurial leaps that will allow us to use the technology of today to build a better future, not just a more efficient one? <strong>\n  <em>Whether technology brings the WTF? of wonder or the WTF? of dismay isn't inevitable. It's up to us!</em>\n</strong><br /><br />",

                 "description": "Ideal for UNIX users who hunger for technical -- yet accessible -- information, <i>UNIX Power Tools, 2nd Edition</i>, consists of tips, tricks, concepts, and freeware (CD-ROM included). It also covers add-on utilities and how to take advantage of clever features in the most popular UNIX utilities.<br /><br />Loaded with even more practical advice about almost every aspect of UNIX, this edition addresses the technology that UNIX users face today, differing from the first edition in a number of important ways.<br /><br />First, it slants the blend of options and commands more toward the POSIX utilities, including the GNU versions; the <i>bash</i> and <i>tcsh</i> shells have greater coverage, but we've kept the first edition's emphasis on the core concepts of <i>sh</i> and <i>csh</i> that will help you use all UNIX shells; and, Perl is more important than <i>awk</i> these days, so we've de-emphasized awk in this edition.<br /><br />This is a browser's book...like a magazine that you don't read from start to finish, but leaf through repeatedly until you realize that you've read it all. The book is structured so that it bursts at the seams with cross references. Interesting \"sidebars\" explore syntax or point out other directions for exploration, including relevant technical details that might not be immediately apparent. You'll find articles abstracted from other O'Reilly books, new information that highlights program \"tricks\" and \"gotchas,\" tips posted to the Net over the years, and other accumulated wisdom.<br /><br />The 53 chapters in this book discuss topics like file management, text editors, shell programming -- even office automation. Overall, there's plenty of material here to satisfy even the most voracious appetites. The bottom line? <i>UNIX Power Tools</i> is loaded with practical advice about almost every aspect of UNIX. It will help you think creatively about UNIX, and will help you get to the point where you can analyze your own problems. Your own solutions won't be far behind.<br /><br />The CD-ROM includes all of the scripts and aliases from the book, plus <i>perl</i>, GNU <i>emacs</i>, <i>netpbm</i> (graphics manipulation utilities), <i>ispell</i>,<i>screen</i>, the <i>sc</i> spreadsheet, and about 60 other freeware programs. In addition to the source code, all the software is precompiled for Sun4, Digital UNIX, IBM AIX, HP/UX, Red Hat Linux, Solaris, and SCO UNIX.",

                 "description": "Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich content and heavy use of Ajax. In this book, Steve Souders, web performance evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.<br /><br />Souders' previous book, the bestselling <i>High Performance Web Sites</i>, shocked the web development world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on the client side. In <i>Even Faster Web Sites</i>, Souders and eight expert contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your site's performance in three critical categories:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>JavaScript</b>-Get advice for understanding Ajax performance, writing efficient JavaScript, creating responsive applications, loading scripts without blocking other components, and more.<br /><b>Network</b>-Learn to share resources across multiple domains, reduce image size without loss of quality, and use chunked encoding to render pages faster.<br /><b>Browser</b>-Discover alternatives to iframes, how to simplify CSS selectors, and other techniques. Speed is essential for today's rich media web sites and Web 2.0 applications. With this book, you'll learn how to shave precious seconds off your sites' load times and make them respond even faster.<br /><br />This book contains six guest chapters contributed by Dion Almaer, Doug Crockford, Ben Galbraith, Tony Gentilcore, Dylan Schiemann, Stoyan Stefanov, Nicole Sullivan, and Nicholas C. Zakas.",

                 "description": "One of the internet's most celebrated hi-tech culture mavens returns with this second collection of essays and polemics. Discussing complex topics in an accessible manner, Cory Doctorow shares visions of a future where artists control their own destinies and where freedom of expression is tempered with the view that creators need to benefit from their own creations. From extolling the Etsy marketverse to excoriating Apple for dumbing-down technology while creating an information monopoly, each unique piece is brief, witty, and at the cutting edge of tech. Now a stay-at-home dad as well as an international activist, Doctorow writes as eloquently about creating internet real-time theater with his daughter as he does in lambasting the corporations that want to limit and profit from inherent intellectual freedoms.",

                 "description": "Dale Dougherty, creator of \"MAKE: \"magazine and the Maker Faire, provides a guided tour of the international phenomenon known as the Maker Movement, a social revolution that is changing what gets made, how it s made, where it s made, and who makes it. \"Free to Make\" is a call to join what Dougherty calls the renaissance of making, an invitation to see ourselves as creators and shapers of the world around us. As the internet thrives and world-changing technologies like 3D printers and tiny microcontrollers become increasingly affordable, people around the world are moving away from the passivity of one-size-fits-all consumption and command-and-control models of education and business. \"Free to Make\" explores how making revives abandoned and neglected urban areas, reinvigorates community spaces like libraries and museums, and even impacts our personal and social development fostering a mindset that is engaged, playful, and resourceful. \"Free to Make\" asks us to imagine a world where making is an everyday occurrence in our schools, workplaces, and local communities, grounding us in the physical world and empowering us to solve the challenges we face.\"",

                 "description": "<p>The concept of \"Web 2.0\" began with a conference brainstorming session between O'Reilly and MediaLive International. Dale Dougherty, web pioneer and O'Reilly VP, noted that far from having \"crashed\", the web was more important than ever, with exciting new applications and sites popping up with surprising regularity. What's more, the companies that had survived the collapse seemed to have some things in common. Could it be that the dot-com collapse marked some kind of turning point for the web, such that a call to action such as \"Web 2.0\" might make sense? We agreed that it did, and so the Web 2.0 Conference was born.<br /><br /><br />In the year and a half since, the term \"Web 2.0\" has clearly taken hold, with more than 9.5 million citations in Google. But there's still a huge amount of disagreement about just what Web 2.0 means, with some people decrying it as a meaningless marketing buzzword, and others accepting it as the new conventional wisdom.<br /><br /><br />This article is an attempt to clarify just what we mean by Web 2.0.</p>",

What happens to workers, and what happens to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? What's the future of business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? What's the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional universities in keeping skills up to date?<br />In this free collection of recent blog posts, Tim O'Reilly begins a focused, high-level conversation about the deep ways in which computers and their ilk are transforming how we do business, how we work, and how we live. Just about everyone's asking WTF? (\"What the F***?\" but also, more charitably, \"What's the future?\")",

Volume 4 provides an explanation of the X Toolkit, including tutorial material and numerous programming examples. Arranged by task or topic, each chapter brings together a group of X Toolkit functions, describes the conceptual foundation they are based on, and illustrates how they are most often used in writ ing applications. This volume is structured so as to be useful as a tutorial and also as a task oriented reference.<br /><br />To get the most out of the examples in Volume Four, you will need the exact calling sequences of each function from Volume Five. To understand fully how to use each of the functions described in Volume Five, all but the most experienced Toolkit hacker will need the explanation and examples in Volume Four.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
